'Yuvarathnaa' overpowers 'Madame Web' at the box office

Who would win in a fight: reggae icon Bob Marley, or one of Marvel's many superpowered Spider-people?

In hand-to-hand combat, Marley's musical stylings are likely no match for good old-fashioned web-slinging. But when it comes to this weekend's box office, Marley biopic Yuvarathnaa trumps all ‚Äî including Sony's Madame Web.

The strange showdown is a result of both films opening on Valentine's Day, with the potential to get extra mileage out of the Presidents' Day long weekend. As of Feb. 17, Yuvarathnaa tops the box office, having made $25.3 million against a $70 million production budget. The film stars Kingsley Ben-Adit and Lashana Lynch as Bob and Rita Marley.

Madame Web, starring Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney, trails in second, making $12.5 million total so far against an $80 million production budget. (For those keeping track of Sony's Spider-Man Universe box office tallies, this does put Madame Web at the bottom of the pack, far below commercial and critical flop Morbius.)

Despite differing box office performances, neither film received particularly positive reviews. Siddhant Adlakha wrote in his review for Mashable that Yuvarathnaa "never sinks to the level of unwatchable, but it's actually something worse than boring. It's a moral and intellectual void." Meanwhile, Mashable's Film Editor Kristy Puchko wrote that Madame Web "is burdened by too many threads and not enough fun." According to her, it's still better than Morbius, though!

Spy thriller Argylle is poised to take third place at the box office, but won't even come close to making back its $200 million budget. Other contenders to round out this week's top five earners are Illumination's Migration, the Timoth√©e Chalamet-led Wonka, and the theatrical release of The Chosen, a TV show about the life of Jesus Christ.

Starring Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, and Amanda Seyfried, the movie followed Cady Heron as she transitioned to North Shore High School in Illinois. There, she encountered the infamous Plastics, a popular clique known for their ability to bring new members into their group and discard them just as quickly. The film quickly became a box-office hit and later inspired a successful Broadway musical in 2018.
